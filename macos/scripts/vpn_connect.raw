# running with osascript from a non-compiled file, will compile to a .scpt file
# and in the process tell application will launch the app if it's not already open
# however if you compile it then it won't do this, so need to check if it's open
# so better not to compile it I think? https://stackoverflow.com/a/16071855/6220759

# Xmonad stuff

You can put the xmonad file in ~/.config/xmonad/ (ie `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). I _think_ `.xmobarrc` should go in `$XDG_HOME`, not sure though.

I have been using gdm3 as a display manager on Ubuntu, and found that I just needed to run the `.xprofile` file here to get Hebrew/English layout working.

; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
; are the three important ones:
;
; + `doom-font'
; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;   presentations or streaming.
;
; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
; font string. You generally only need these two:

(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Mono for Powerline" :size 16)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "ETBembo" :size 24))

; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;
; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
; - `use-package' for configuring packages
; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;   `require' or `use-package'.
; - `map!' for binding new keys
;
; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c g k').
; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.

; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c g d') to jump to their definition and see how
; they are implemented.
